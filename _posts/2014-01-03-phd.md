I work as a research assistant in computer science education at the University of Paderborn. You can find my homepage <a href="http://ddi.uni-paderborn.de/personen/laura-ohrndorf.html">here.</a> I finished my PhD in October 2016.

My main research interests lie in the field of empirical research, especially data analysis. I am a huge fan of the statistical programming language called <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>.
I am also enrolled in the the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. You can find my finished projects <a href="https://github.com/Laura-O/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree">here</a>.
