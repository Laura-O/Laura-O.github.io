According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing">Wikipedia</a>, speedcubing is the "activity of solving a variety of twisty puzzles, the most famous being the Rubik's Cube, as quickly as possible". As of today, I have competed in more than 90 official competitions in 10 countries. You can find my official results profile <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2009OHRN01">here</a>.<br/>

I am the leader of the WCA Regulations Committee (WRC), which is responsible for managing the regulations. Furthermore, I am also a WCA Delegate. Delegates are people who make sure that the regulations are applied correctly in competitions.
