In my free time, I also like doing stuff that is often called "Making": printing things with my 3D printer, tinkering, programming...

My first 3D printer was an M3D Mini, which got too small and too slow soon, so I am now using a [FlashForge Dreamer](http://www.flashforge-usa.com/shop/3d-printers/flashforge-dreamer-dual-extrusion-3d-printer.html/).

My probably biggest project was a [Pocket PiGRRL](http://www.thingiverse.com/make:172645) - a small handheld game console using a Raspberry Pi.
